# Machine Learning Approach to Facies Classification and Clustering using UP Field's Well Log Data

This paper discusses the comparison of several commonly used machine learning algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Clas-sifier in the context of facies classification, and K-Means Clustering in the context of facies clus-tering. The main objectives of this paper are to determine the appropriate input features to be used in facies classification prediction, to determine the best machine learning classification algorithm in facies classification prediction, to perform facies clustering with K-Means Clustering and compare the data distribution statistics per facies class, and to evaluate the prediction model that has been created. This study uses well log data from the UP Field that includes attributes relevant to facies classification. Each algorithm is then applied to the dataset and the results are evaluated using confusion metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, R-2 score and F1-score. The results of the machine learning approach using the KNN model can provide a higher level of accuracy with an R-2 score of 0.90 and F-1 of 0.95
